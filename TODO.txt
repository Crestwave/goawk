* failing interp_test with f1() and f2()
* failing TravisCI tests with write error if possible
* getInputScanner issues (see GAWK tests closebad and inputred)
* support "getline lvalue"
* should interp have a configurable "safe" mode that doesn't run
  system(), redirection, etc?
* fix how we handle numstr type when setting $0 directly, see TODO test:
  {`BEGIN { $0="0"; print !$0 }`, "", "0\n", "", ""},
* get large awk files going from FreeBSD:
  - support length(array)
  - support delete array
  - can't pass scalar "p_layout" as array param in nvram_map_gen.awk
  feeder_rate_mkfilter.awk
  makeobjops.awk
  mtree-dedup.awk
  nvram_map_gen.awk
