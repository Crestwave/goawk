* does the stash'd change speed things up?
* address Travis build error:
    --- FAIL: TestInterp/BEGIN_{_print_|"out";_getline_<"out"_}__#_!awk_!gawk (0.00s)
        interp_test.go:590: expected error "can't read from writer stream", got "write |1: broken pipe"
* performance testing: I/O, allocations, CPU
  + PoC: is interpreting via a "heavy AST" faster?
    i.e., with execute functions on the AST elements instead of the switch/case
* release 1.0.0 (do anything for Go modules?)
* remove notice about "beta" from README.md
